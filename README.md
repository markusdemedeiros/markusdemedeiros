*Hi!* I'm Markus (he/him), a combined honours student in cs and math at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in **the interaction between proofs and code**, through *langauge design*, *software practices*, and *theorem provers* (including theorem provers made of meat).

If your project sounds like the above, or you're just in the market for a relentless Haskell sycophant, [hit me up on my site](https://www.markusde.ca)!
