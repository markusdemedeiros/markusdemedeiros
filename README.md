*Hi!* I'm Markus (he/him), a combined honours student in cs and math at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in **breaking down the barriers between proofs and code**, through *langauge design*, *software practices*, and *theorem provers* (including theorem provers made of meat). 

#### My Current Fascinations Include

- The [correspondence between type theory, computation, and category theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computational+trilogy).
- Applications of [semigroup theory for DFA's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06345); the computational holonomy decomposition. 
- Exploring the limits of computability with high level, proof-oriented langauges such as Idris, and
- The realization of proof practices to low- and systems- level projects. 


#### Contact me!

If your project sounds like the above, or you're just in the market for a relentless Haskell nutjob, [hit me up on my site](https://www.markusde.ca)!
